### Team Reflection:
How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any?
> Piazza, email, discord. Basically just strangers meeting online.

How did you make decisions?
> Democracy (ask each other for opinions, decide based on majority).

How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting (on average)
> For now, Ryan decided on the priority and points for each user story, and everyone else edits it as they see fit. We will (maybe) be holding a more formal voting session before finalizing on the priority and points.

Did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?
> Don’t know yet, we have not held the formal voting session.

Did you meet in person or online?
> Online

How frequently did you meet?
> Once so far.

What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?
> Online classes and groups don’t mix well, since people are in different timezones.
