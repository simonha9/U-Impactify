U-impactify is an e-learning and e-facilitation platform for creating an ecosystem where low-income individuals and organizations, such as social purpose or non-profit organizations, can come together to learn, teach, facilitate, and provide support for one another. The platform utilizes a low-cost subscription fee that allow students to take a certain number of courses. As well as individual courses offered at a set price.

### Here are 3 types of key users, with their respective use cases:
1. Social Initiative
    These are the social purpose, non-profit organizations, who perhaps lack the funding to hire professionals or train their employees.
    On U-Impactify, a social initiative can:
    - Offer employment, volunteer, and consulting opportunities
    - Develop the skills of their employees by having them take courses and coaching sessions on U-impactify

2. Impact Consultant
    These are the “instructors” of the platform.
    On U-Impactify, an impact consultant can:
    - Offer e-learning, e-facilitation, and e-coaching services
    - Apply for consultant opportunities that the social initiatives offer

3. Impact Learner
    These are the “students” of the platform.
    On U-Impactify, an impact learner can:
    - Develop their skills through the learning and coaching services that the impact consultants offer
    - Apply for the job and volunteer opportunities that the social initiatives offer


A special feature of U-Impactify is Giving Garden. If a social initiative cannot afford a desired service from some impact consultant, they can “ask” for the service. And if the consultant has offered his courses to a certain number of people, U-Impactify will pay this consultant to serve any social initiative of his/her choice. Moreover, external donors can donate to Giving Garden such that impact learners and social initiatives can get free/subsidized prices on the various services.
